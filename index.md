## Hi, I'm Jacob
I'm just your average high school developer. Ok, maybe not. I'm a self taught developer, and I'm fluent in HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Nodejs, Npmjs, Vuejs and Nuxtjs. I've hosted Desica's iDesign podcast, and am founder of [Desica](https://desica.uk/). I even have my own themed version of bootstrap, [Desikit](https://npmjs.com/desikit).
