## Hi, I'm Jacob
I'm Jacob and I'm a developer who loves nuxtjs. I work for myself and my company, Desica. I've been working on design guidelines at [desikit](https://desikit.vercel.app). A massive thank you to the folks at js.org for providing this domain.

### My projects
I'm currently in the process of moving my projects over to this repo. When I'm done, links will appear here.
